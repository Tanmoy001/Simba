Scala is a high-level programming language that combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.
It is designed to be concise, expressive, and interoperable with Java, running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Scala supports features like immutability, pattern matching, higher-order functions, and a strong static type system, making it suitable for building scalable and concurrent applications.

Key Features of Scala:
1. **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Scala is an object, including functions.
2. **Functional**: Supports first-class functions, immutability, and functional constructs.
3. **Interoperability**: Fully compatible with Java, allowing the use of Java libraries.
4. **Type Inference**: Reduces boilerplate code by inferring types automatically.
5. **Concurrency**: Provides tools like Akka for building concurrent and distributed systems.

Scala is widely used in data processing, web development, and distributed systems.
